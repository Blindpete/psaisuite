# Azure AI

To use Azure AI with `psaisuite` you will need to [create an Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and deploy Azure OpenAI resources. After setting up your Azure AI service, you'll need to get your API key and endpoint URL from the Azure portal. Once you have your key and endpoint, add them to your environment as follows:

```shell
$env:AzureAIKey = "your-azure-ai-api-key"
$env:AzureAIEndpoint = "your-azure-ai-endpoint"
```

## Create a Chat Completion

Install `psaisuite` from the PowerShell Gallery.

```powershell
Install-Module PSAISuite
```

In your code:

```powershell
# Import the module
Import-Module PSAISuite

$provider = "azureai"
$model_id = "gpt-4o"  # Use the model you've deployed on your Azure AI service

# Create the model identifier
$model = "{0}:{1}" -f $provider, $model_id
$Message = New-ChatMessage -Prompt "What is the capital of France?"
Invoke-ChatCompletion -Message $Message -Model $model
```

```shell
Messages  : {"role":"user","content":"What is the capital of France?"}
Response  : The capital of France is Paris.
Model     : azureai:gpt-4o
Provider  : azureai
ModelName : gpt-4o
